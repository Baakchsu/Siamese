The folder 'Test_network_data' contains genuine and forged signatures of three people that were taken from the evaluation set and were not used in training. 

This is to facilitate testing of this model and additionally you can use any signature images that are in similar format of the round 2 dataset that was provided and the images must have a minimum size of 200x200.

Since the training is already done, the user can just use model.py to verify signatures.
